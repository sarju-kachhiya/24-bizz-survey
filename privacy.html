                                you in connection with obtaining quotes for insurance products and services. For example, you will be asked to provide your full name, address, telephone number, email, and other information in order to be matched to carriers
                                and agents who may provide you a quote for their services. We also collect demographic information. Demographic information is all other information such as gender, zip code, or any information that is not tied to your
                                personal information. In addition, we might receive information about you from other online or offline sources and may add that information to your existing account.

                            <p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure.</b><br>We share personal information about you under the following circumstances: If you submit a request on the Site for quotes for products or services, we will share the personal information
                                contained in your request form (such as your full name, address, telephone number, email, information about your cars, etc.) with third parties, which include agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other service providers

                                For example, we may now or in the future use your Social Security Number, your Year of Birth, or your personal information to obtain your credit report and credit score to help us better match you with Service Providers.
                                All Service Providers in our network have entered into agreements with us, and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. By submitting your request to us, you understand that Service Providers may
                                contact you by telephone (on a recorded line), automated calling, email, SMS/text messaging or regular mail based on the information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted

                                wish not to be contacted again by that Service Provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Service Provider not to contact you again. Please note that the Service Providers

                                our Site and on the websites of third parties. As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state
                                audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
